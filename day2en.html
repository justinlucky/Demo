                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manipur (/ˌmʌnɪˈpʊər/,[8] US also /ˌmænɪˈpʊər/:[9] Meitei: Kangleipak[a][10][11][12]) is a state in
                    northeast India, with the city of Imphal as its capital.[13] It is bounded by the Indian states of
                    Nagaland to the north, Mizoram to the south and Assam to the west. It also borders two regions of
                    Myanmar, Sagaing Region to the east and Chin State to the south. The state covers an area of 22,327
                    km2 (8,621 sq mi). The official and most widely spoken language is Meitei language (officially known
                    as Manipuri language). Native to the Meitei people, it is also used as a lingua franca by smaller
                    communities, who speak a variety of other Sino-Tibetan languages.[14] Manipur has been at the
                    crossroads of Asian economic and cultural exchange for more than 2,500 years.[15] Said exchange
                    connects the Indian subcontinent and Central Asia to Southeast Asia, East Asia, Siberia, regions in
                    the Arctic, Micronesia and Polynesia enabling migration of people, cultures and religions.[16][17]

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the days of the Indian Empire, the Kingdom of Manipur was one of the princely states.[18]
                    Between 1917 and 1939, some people of Manipur pressed the princely rulers for democracy. By the late
                    1930s, the princely state of Manipur negotiated with the British administration its preference to
                    continue to be part of the Indian Empire, rather than part of Burma, which was being separated from
                    India. These negotiations were cut short with the outbreak of World War II in 1939. On 11 August
                    1947, Maharaja Budhachandra signed an Instrument of Accession, joining the new Indian Union.[19][20]
                    Later, on 21 September 1949, he signed a Merger Agreement, merging the kingdom into India, which led
                    to its becoming a Part C State.[21][22] This merger was later disputed by groups in Manipur, as
                    having been completed without consensus and under duress.[23] The dispute and differing visions for
                    the future has resulted in a 50-year insurgency in the state for independence from India, as well as
                    in repeated episodes of violence among ethnic groups in the state.[24] From 2009 through 2018, the
                    conflict was responsible for the violent deaths of over 1000 people.[25]</p>
